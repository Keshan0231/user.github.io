            <h2>Welcome to Jaya Taekwon-Do Accademy</h2>
            <i><b><h3>What is Taekwon-Do?</h3></b></i>
            <p>Taekwondo, Tae Kwon Do or Taekwon-Do (/ˌtaɪkwɒnˈdoʊ, ˌtaɪˈkwɒndoʊ/;Korean: 태권도/跆拳道 [t̪ʰɛ.k͈wʌ̹n.d̪o]) is a Korean form of martial arts involving punching and kicking techniques, 
                with emphasis on head-height kicks, spinning jump kicks, and fast kicking techniques. The literal translation for tae kwon do is "kicking", "punching", and "the art or way of".
                They are a kind of martial arts in which one attacks or defends with hands and feet anytime or anywhere, with occasional use of weapons. The physical training undertaken in Taekwondo 
                is purposeful and fosters strength of mind through mental armament.Taekwondo practitioners wear a uniform, known as a dobok. It is a combat sport and was developed during the 1940s 
                and 1950s by Korean martial artists with experience in martial arts such as karate, Chinese martial arts, and indigenous Korean martial arts traditions such as Taekkyon, Subak, and Gwonbeop. 
                The oldest governing body for Taekwondo is the Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA), formed in 1959 through a collaborative effort by representatives from the nine original kwans, 
                or martial arts schools, in Korea. The main international organisational bodies for Taekwondo today are the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF), founded by Choi Hong-hi in 1966, 
                and the partnership of the Kukkiwon and World Taekwondo (WT, formerly World Taekwondo Federation or WTF), founded in 1972 and 1973 respectively by the Korea Taekwondo Association.
                 Gyeorugi ([kjʌɾuɡi]), a type of full-contact sparring, has been an Olympic event since 2000. In 2018, the South Korean government officially designated Taekwondo as Korea's national martial art.</p>
